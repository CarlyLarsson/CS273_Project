They're the solution to the equation slope minus y/x equals 1. So, anywhere on any of those curves the slope minus y/x equals 1. How about something big like a turtle? Let slope - 3y/x = x.	@afrazer311	Roman J. Israel, Esq.	United States of America	Washington	Olympia	Neutral	Anger	Twitter	M	1010	29	273	@UCLA Reducing a carbon footprint even that of a butterfly.
