The 1st movie ended (spoilers) w/ Connor defeating the Kurgan, making him the last remaining Immortal, & thus winning the Prize. It just didn't call 4 a sequel, & none of the sequels were good.	@spar10leonidas	(((Spar10Leonidas)))				Negative	Neutral	Twitter						@AlmedinaAlexis @Blockbustedpod I think 1 key difference w/ Highlander is that a sequel 2 that doesn't make any sense.
