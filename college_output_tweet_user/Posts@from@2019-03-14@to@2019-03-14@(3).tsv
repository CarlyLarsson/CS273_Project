In other words, how'd they even make the team when they shouldn't have gotten in the first place?

Her test scores should be invalidated. The student-athletes have to go through so much to earn their scholarships, pass college entrance exams, get accepted into a school, and get certified by the NCAA. I don't feel sorry for her.	@Mommypreneur77	The Mommypreneur Life	United States of America	Florida		Neutral	Sadness	Twitter		6105	340	603	@WakeForest @PresidentHatch I will be contacting the NCAA Clearinghouse.

I know who the student and the parents are involved, She should be expelled from the school and made to reapply on her own merit. I am not buying for one minute that she was not aware of what took place.	@Mommypreneur77	The Mommypreneur Life	United States of America	Florida		Negative	Disgust	Twitter		6104	340	603	@WakeForest @PresidentHatch I hope someone is reading this post.
